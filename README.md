# Solana-Bib
A collection of various (open source) Solana programs. The library is structured in such a way that the programs can be automatically scanned. This is intended to facilitate security research.

This library allows security researchers to automatically test tools and new techniques.
Everyone is welcome to take part and add their program!

To do this, please follow the instructions below:
1. Any number of other folders and files can be located in the main folder, eg security.txt, license, readme etc. However, the programs folder must be located here!
2. The Programs folder must be in a form in which the program can be compiled. name: "programs"
3. If possible, please include audits in the main folder
